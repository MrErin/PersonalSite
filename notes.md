## Design ideas

* I'd love to do an interactive resume. Not sure if that's too ambitious for right now.
* Maybe a take on MST3K doors, with each door opening to reveal another section of the resume, including styling in line with the doors from the show:

Mike era
6. A pair of doors with circular windows that open away from the camera, and to the camera when closing. Note: This door also shows a mouse zipping by on the floor, both when opening and closing. From episode 812 onward, the sound effects when closing later changed.
5. Door opens with six triangular-shaped wedges moving away from the center when opening, and to each other when closing.
4. A drawbridge with red-colored lights on its backside that falls down when opening, and lifts up when closing.
3. A door with holes cut in it, pink lighting, and bubbles floating that opens by sliding up when opening, and sliding down when closing.
2. A door decorated with various bones and skeletons and two screens showing a "Movie Countdown" that opens away from the camera when opening, and to the camera when closing
1- Grey hatch with the numbers 1-6 and a white tire around it that flips open to the right when opening, leading to the theater, and to the left when closing.
