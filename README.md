# Personal Site with React

This is a redesign (or recode with the same design) of my [personal site](http://www.erinmeaker.com), which was originally built in plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Project Goals:

- Keep the design as close as possible to the original (colors, typography, light bulb should be basically the same)
- Use React to display projects & work history
- Use Material Design for styling

## Learning Goals:

- Solidify understanding of React
- Learn how to copy an existing design in Material UI
- Solidify understanding of TypeScript

## To Run

1. Clone the repo.
1. From the command line, cd into the "react_redesign" directory. Make sure you're not in the "oldSite" directory.
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
