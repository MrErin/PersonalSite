# Personal Website

A single page website to serve as a resume & portfolio for my projects.

## Concept:

There will be a light bulb graphic as the background of the page. When the page loads, the bulb will be off. As the user scrolls down through my resume, the background will change, the lightbulb first turning on, then getting brighter. At the end of the page, there will be lightning inside the bulb, symbolizing some cool ideas or whatever.
